👋 Hi, I’m Lilian, a Full-Stack Developer passionate about solving real life problems with code. My background is in food security and Agriculture (I know right?), but my love for Tech and building meaningful life-changing projects overtook me (the heart wants what it wants 🥰🥰). I currently work as a Software Engineer with a global company with great company culture and I love it.

👀 I’m interested in using data for good by building front-end and back-end projects that meet the daily needs of users.

🌱 I’m currently learning C# and Redux and taking part in the 100 Days of Python Challenge💪.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects, network with like-minds and ultimately form meaningful friendships.
