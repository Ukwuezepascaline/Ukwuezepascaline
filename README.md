 👋 Hi, I’m Pascaline, a Front-end Developer passionate about solving real life problems with code. My background is in Nutrition and Dietetics, but my love for Tech and building meaningful life-changing projects overtook me (the heart wants what it wants 🥰🥰). I graduated from Alx Software Engineering program and recently concluded a 6months traning program with Women Techsters Fellowship, and am so proud of my accomplishments.


- 👀 I’m interested in using data for good by building front-end projects that meet the daily needs of users.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on different projects using React.js and tailwind CSS.
- 💞️ I collaborate on open source projects, network with like-minds and ultimately form meaningful friendships.
